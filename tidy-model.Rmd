## INTRODUCTION 

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

<!-- Load Data Chunk -->

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

<!-- What factors affect the chirp rate? -->
## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

Number of species - 31, temp max 30.4, min 17.2, mean rate of chirping - 72.89

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
