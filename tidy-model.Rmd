## INTRODUCTION 

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

<!-- Load Data Chunk -->

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

<!-- What factors affect the chirp rate? -->
## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
```
